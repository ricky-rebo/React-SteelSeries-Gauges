Diffs from MASTER branch

- Removed from controller all the code unrelated to Weather Display configs and data processing
	- removed WProgram enum and related config
	- removed various switchs and checks in constructor and start


- Fixed controller Status
	- defined a standard structure for all statuses
	- no ledBlink bool flag, ledState now has three states: "on" | "blink" | "off"
	- now we only have:
		- Loading (initial state)
		- OK
		- Warning (station offline)
		- Error (file not found, controller timeout, generical error) -> HERE the controller STOPS


- Fixed 'RtData' interface:
	- Only WD data structure, no optional attributes (based on customclientrawlocat.txt v14)
	- Modified even customclientrawlocal.txt template, now provide directly numerical values,
		no string to number conversion needed


- General refctoring and file renaming:
	- controller/data_utils.ts 			-> controller/utils.ts
	- controller/data_types.ts 			-> controller/types.ts
	- controller/gauges_controller 	-> controller/controller.ts
	- gauges/gauge_utils.ts 				-> gauges/utils.ts
	- gauge/gauge_types.ts 					-> gauges/types.ts


- Moved all config related to gauge style and format away from the controller
	- All gauge default configs moved in gauges/defaults.ts
	- Removed various configs, including 'gaugeScaling' -> now gauge use directly 'props.size'
	- Removed 'params' container from gauges, now it is created and passed directly in 'componendDidMount()'
		when the gauge is created
	- Instead of 'params', now gauges have 'config' object, actually filled
		only with defaults values from gauges/defaults.ts
		(maybe in future implement the possibility to use custom configs via props?)


- Specific utility functions, used by a single gauge, moved within the gauge .tsx file itself


- Fixed various types in gauges
